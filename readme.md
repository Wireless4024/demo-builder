> I made this project to create a demo project in my work.

# Concept

+ One file object-based route system
+ Just type `npm i && npm start` to run
+ Built-in sqlite database

# Getting started
+ Download this repo
+ Change package name in [`package.json`](./package.json)
+ Run `npm i`
+ Start editing [`src/main.ts`](./src/main.ts)

---

# Note:

+ Example are in src folder (don't forgot to remove them when using on your own)
+ If you have any error you can try to replace `esrun` with [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
+ Feel free to open issue or feature request
